          <h1>Step 1: Secure your firewall</h1>
          <p>
            If an attacker is able to gain administrative access to your
            firewall it is “game over” for your network security. Therefore,
            securing your firewall is the first and most important step of this
            process. Never put a firewall into production that is not properly
            secured by at least the following configuration actions: Update your
            firewall to the latest firmware. Delete, disable, or rename any
            default user accounts and change all default passwords. Make sure to
            use only complex and secure passwords. If multiple administrators
            will manage the firewall, create additional administrator accounts
            with limited privileges based on responsibilities. Never use shared
            user accounts. Disable simple network management protocol (SNMP) or
            configure it to use a secure community string.
          </p>
          <h1>Step 2: Architect your firewall zones and IP addresses</h1>
          <p>
            In order to protect the valuable assets on your network, you should
            first identify what the assets are (for example, payment card data
            or patient data). Then plan out your network structure so that these
            assets can be grouped together and placed into networks (or zones)
            based on similar sensitivity level and function. For example, all of
            your servers that provide services over the internet (web servers,
            email servers, virtual private network (VPN) servers, etc.) should
            be placed into a dedicated zone that will allow limited inbound
            traffic from the internet (this zone is often called a demilitarized
            zone or DMZ). Servers that should not be accessed directly from the
            internet, such as database servers, must be placed in internal
            server zones instead. Likewise, workstations, point of sale devices,
            and voice over Internet protocol (VOIP) systems can usually be
            placed in internal network zones. Generally speaking, the more zones
            you create, the more secure your network. But keep in mind that
            managing more zones requires additional time and resources, so you
            need to be careful when deciding how many network zones you want to
            use. If you are using IP version 4, Internal IP addresses should be
            used for all of your internal networks. Network address translation
            (NAT) must be configured to allow internal devices to communicate on
            the Internet when necessary. Once you have designed your network
            zone structure and established the corresponding IP address scheme,
            you are ready to create your firewall zones and assign them to your
            firewall interfaces or subinterfaces. As you build out your network
            infrastructure, switches that support virtual LANs (VLANs) should be
            used to maintain level-2 separation between the networks.
          </p>
          <h1>Step 3: Configure access control lists</h1>
          <p>
            Now that you have established your network zones and assigned them
            to interfaces, you should determine exactly which traffic needs to
            be able to flow into and out of each zone. This traffic will be
            permitted using firewall rules called access control lists (ACLs),
            which are applied to each interface or subinterface on the firewall.
            Make your ACLs specific to the exact source and/or destination IP
            addresses and port numbers whenever possible. At the end of every
            access control list, make sure there is a “deny all” rule to filter
            out all unapproved traffic. Apply both inbound and outbound ACLs to
            each interface and subinterface on your firewall so that only
            approved traffic is allowed into and out of each zone. Whenever
            possible, it is generally advised to disable your firewall
            administration interfaces (including both secure shell (SSH) and web
            interfaces) from public access. This will help to protect your
            firewall configuration from outside threats. Make sure to disable
            all unencrypted protocols for firewall management, including Telnet
            and HTTP connections.
          </p>
          <h1>Step 4: Configure your other firewall services and logging</h1>
          <p>
            If your firewall is also capable of acting as a dynamic host
            configuration protocol (DHCP) server, network time protocol (NTP)
            server, intrusion prevention system (IPS), etc., then go ahead and
            configure the services you wish to use. Disable all the extra
            services that you don’t intend to use. To fulfill PCI DSS
            requirements, configure your firewall to report to your logging
            server, and make sure that enough detail is included to satisfy
            requirement 10.2 through 10.3 of the PCI DSS. SEE ALSO:

          </p>
          <h1>Step 5: Test your firewall configuration</h1>
          <p>
            In a test environment, verify that your firewall works as intended.
            Don’t forget to verify that your firewall is blocking traffic that
            should be blocked according to your ACL configurations. Testing your
            firewall should include both vulnerability scanning and penetration
            testing. Once you have finished testing your firewall, your firewall
            should be ready for production. Always remember to keep a backup of
            your firewall configuration saved in a secure place so that all of
            your hard work is not lost in the event of a hardware failure.
            Remember, this is just an overview to help you understand the major
            steps of firewall configuration. When using tutorials, or even if
            you decide to configure your own firewall, be sure to have a
            security expert review your configuration to make sure it is set up
            to keep your data as safe as possible.
