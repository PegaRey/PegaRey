                It just started on plans to upgrade a pc, but Callo influenced
                me on how some 2nd hand components can be much cheaper than the
                brand new ones, then we experimented on some computers what
                makes the computer works and researched how the computer worked
                and by the time we know it, we can build a pc on our own.

          <h1>Begginings</h1>
          <p>
            in my Senior high School years i planned to take a civil engineering
            course, that's why i picked Stem Strand in the first place. i
            gathered ideas and knowledge on what to expect in the civil
            engineering course with the help of my cousin who is a student in
            Malayan College and currently passed the Board examination. father
            retired while i was in my Senior Highschool years and we planned to
            have a business to have an income because father was basically
            jobless. all is good and everything went well except when our house
            caught on fire while we were away. I lost everything that day, my
            clothes, my things, basically all, what i have is only my cellphone
            and my clothes i'm currently wearing at that time. my moms room
            survived only the half but with all the important documents that
            father has was not burnt. we recieved donations from generous
            friends and peoples and we were very gratefull on how many people
            helped us, tho we were deteermined to finish the businesses that we
            started. we built a computer shop and a "Sisig shop", there i got
            facinated by how the computers works and i was willing to learn how
            it works, when i graduated i decided to take BSIT course because of
            my main goal, that one day i will create something revolutionary,
            tho it is most likely to be achieved. One day my friend is Creating
            a Game in Roblox and i was fascinated too, so i decided to help him.
            piece by piece we learnt and researched how to create this and that
            until we got the game in good running condition, tho we did'nt
            finish the project it is a good experience for me, that's why i have
            a basic knowledge about programming. the language we used is lua.
            there i was able to meet my childhood friend and classmate Callo and
            we bonded together like crazy, he is very kind and generous, when i
            have nowhere to go during my online class callo was there to help
            me. when the pandemic struck our computer shop was damaged and 2
            years later we closed it permanently. i fiddled with the computers
            because some of them is broken. i tried to fix the others and sell
            it.
